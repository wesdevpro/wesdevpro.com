**wesdevpro** is the professional identity of Wesley Ford—built on a foundation of curiosity, resilience, and code.

My software journey began in my early teens when my grandparents gave me *Coding for Teens*, a book that taught me C++. I built games like Tic Tac Toe and dreamed big—one early idea was an app that could stream music across multiple Bluetooth devices in the house. It didn’t work out (Bluetooth doesn’t quite play that way), but it planted the seed: build intentionally, even if the result isn't perfect.

Years later, during COVID, I helped launch a startup called **Analyst** (`@ntohq/analyst`)—a platform designed to guide traders using news, AI, and personalized metrics. Though it never fully materialized due to funding and college constraints, the lessons were lasting. I’m especially grateful to **Polygin IO** for generously supporting the team with API access during our early prototyping phase.

The stack behind Analyst introduced me to **Buefy**, a lightweight Vue.js UI library I came to appreciate deeply—but soon learned was no longer maintained. So I took initiative: reached out, pulled together a small group of developers including **Kikuo**, and began contributing to its migration to Vue 3.

Since then, I’ve actively maintained Buefy and currently serve as a **Software Developer Intern at SouthState Bank**. The journey has been fast-paced—full of work in scalable UI systems, design tokens, accessibility, and technical growth.
